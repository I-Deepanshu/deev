# DevMind - AI Pair Programmer

![DevMind Logo](https://via.placeholder.com/150x150?text=DevMind)

## Overview

DevMind is a context-aware AI pair programming assistant for VS Code. Unlike traditional AI coding assistants, DevMind understands your codebase at multiple levels of context, from the immediate code you're working on to the broader project architecture.

Powered by Qwen 3 LLM, DevMind offers specialized AI agents for different development tasks, each with deep contextual understanding of your code.

## Features

### üß† Context-First Approach

DevMind analyzes your code at multiple levels:

1. **Immediate Code Context**: Understanding the current file, function, and selection
2. **Project Context**: Analyzing repository structure, dependencies, and configurations
3. **Historical Context**: Learning from Git history and team patterns
4. **External Context**: Applying best practices, ecosystem knowledge, and security awareness

### ü§ñ Specialized AI Agents

DevMind provides six specialized AI agents, each designed for specific development tasks:

- **üèõÔ∏è Architect**: Proposes scalable designs and architecture changes
- **‚öíÔ∏è CodeSmith**: Generates high-quality, idiomatic code
- **üêû BugHunter**: Identifies and fixes bugs with root cause analysis
- **üìö DocGuru**: Creates comprehensive documentation
- **üîÑ GitMate**: Assists with Git operations and commit management
- **üîÑ DevFlow**: Sets up development workflows and automation

### üîí Privacy-First Design

DevMind is designed with privacy as a core principle:

- **Local Processing**: All code analysis happens locally
- **Configurable Privacy Modes**: Control what data is processed
- **Excluded Files/Directories**: Specify sensitive files to exclude from analysis

## Getting Started

### Installation

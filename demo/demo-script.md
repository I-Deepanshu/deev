# DevMind Extension Demo Script

This script provides a structured demonstration of the DevMind extension's key features and capabilities. Use it for presentations, training, or to explore the extension's functionality.

## Setup

1. Ensure DevMind is installed and configured with your Qwen API credentials
2. Open a sample project with multiple files and some complexity
3. Have this script open in a separate window for reference

## Demo Flow

### 1. Introduction (2 minutes)

- Show the DevMind icon in the Activity Bar
- Point out the DevMind status bar icon
- Briefly explain the context-first approach and specialized agents

### 2. Context Analysis (3 minutes)

- Open a complex file in the project
- Click the DevMind icon in the Activity Bar
- Select the "Context Analysis" view
- Explain the different levels of context that DevMind has analyzed:
  - Immediate code context
  - Project context
  - Historical context
  - External context
- Show how DevMind understands the relationships between files and components

### 3. Architect Agent (5 minutes)

- Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
- Type "DevMind: Architect"
- Ask: "What's the overall architecture of this project?"
- Ask: "How could we improve the modularity of this codebase?"
- Show how the Architect agent provides high-level design insights

### 4. CodeSmith Agent (5 minutes)

- Open a file that needs a new feature or improvement
- Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
- Type "DevMind: CodeSmith"
- Ask: "Add a new function to handle user authentication"
- Show how CodeSmith generates high-quality, idiomatic code that fits with the existing codebase

### 5. BugHunter Agent (5 minutes)

- Open a file with a known bug or issue
- Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
- Type "DevMind: BugHunter"
- Ask: "Why is this function not working correctly?"
- Show how BugHunter identifies the root cause and suggests fixes

### 6. DocGuru Agent (3 minutes)

- Open a file with minimal documentation
- Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
- Type "DevMind: DocGuru"
- Ask: "Generate documentation for this file"
- Show how DocGuru creates comprehensive, contextually aware documentation

### 7. Privacy Controls (2 minutes)

- Open VS Code Settings
- Show the DevMind privacy settings
- Explain the different privacy modes
- Demonstrate how to exclude sensitive files from analysis

### 8. Audit Trail (2 minutes)

- Click the DevMind icon in the Activity Bar
- Select the "Audit Trail" view
- Show the history of agent interactions
- Demonstrate searching and filtering the audit trail

### 9. Contextual Agent (3 minutes)

- Click the DevMind icon in the status bar
- Show how DevMind automatically selects the most appropriate agent based on the current task
- Demonstrate how the contextual agent provides relevant assistance

### 10. Q&A (5 minutes)

- Answer questions about the extension
- Provide additional examples based on audience interest
- Discuss potential use cases and integration with existing workflows

## Key Points to Emphasize

- **Context-First Approach**: DevMind understands your code at multiple levels
- **Specialized Agents**: Each agent is designed for specific development tasks
- **Privacy-First Design**: You control what data is processed
- **Seamless Integration**: Works within your existing VS Code workflow
- **Continuous Learning**: DevMind learns from your codebase and improves over time

## Follow-Up Resources

- Refer participants to the USAGE.md file for detailed instructions
- Point them to the README.md for an overview of features
- Encourage them to explore the extension on their own projects
